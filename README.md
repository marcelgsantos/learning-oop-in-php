## Some Questions

***I found not related to PHP resources. Is this correct?***  
The project name is "Learning OOP in PHP". But, despite the name, object oriented programming is a concept related to a lot of other languages like C++, Java, C#, Python, Ruby and so on. That said, exists a lot of fantastic resources like videos and tutorials about object-oriented programming made in another programming languages and I considered reasonable include them here in this reference.

***There are some tutorials that aren't in the correct section?***  
I tried to keep this reference as simple as possible and divided it in a few areas. But there are some problems! Feel free to make any suggestions and contribute.
